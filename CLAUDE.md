# Interf CLI

Open-source CLI for the Agent Readiness Protocol. Published as `interf` on npm.

## Project

- **Package**: `interf` (npm, unscoped) — v2.0.0
- **Repo**: github.com/interf-labs/cli
- **License**: MIT
- **Company**: Interf, Inc. (interf.com)

## Architecture

Skills-based CLI — installs SKILL.md files to coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Goose) that teach them how to scan codebases and simulate enterprise readiness.

No Agent SDK dependency. No network calls. No code execution.

### Key directories

- `src/` — TypeScript source (commands, lib)
- `skills/` — Bundled SKILL.md files (interf-protocol, interf-scan, interf-simulate)
- `dist/` — Compiled output (generated by `npm run build`)

### Commands

- `npx interf` — Auto-detect agents, install all skills
- `interf install-skill` — Install specific skills to specific agents
- `interf validate <file>` — Validate an interf.yaml manifest
- `interf login/logout/publish/simulate` — Stubbed (coming soon)

### Stack

- TypeScript (ES2022, NodeNext)
- yargs (CLI framework)
- zod (schema validation)
- yaml (parsing)
- chalk (output formatting)
- vitest (testing)

## Commands

```bash
npm run build       # Compile TypeScript
npm test            # Run tests (28 tests)
npm publish         # Build + publish to npm
```

## Related packages

- `@interf/gateway` — Deprecated MCP server, replaced by this CLI
- `@interf` — npm org scope reserved for future scoped packages

## Conventions

- Keep dependencies minimal (4 production deps)
- No fake API endpoints — stub commands with "coming soon"
- Skills are the primary interface — the CLI installs them, agents use them
- Follow WorkOS CLI patterns for structure and best practices
